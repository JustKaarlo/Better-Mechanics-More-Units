# ===========================================

# BASE

# max_organisation = 20
# Organisation indicates combat readiness and how organized a unit is.
# Units with no organisation can't fight or move effectively.

# reliability = 0.9
# Reliability controls how often equipment will suffer random failures.

# weight = 0.1
# Weight controls how many transports a unit needs to embark.

# maximum_speed = 0.5
# Maximum speed acts as a "bonus" mulitipler to the speed determined by the unit equipment in km/h.
# The formula for the calculated speed is <base speed> * (1 + maximum_speed)km/h; thus a maximum_speed
# of 0.5 gives a movement speed 50% faster, a maximum_speed of 2 equals 200% faster, etc.

# supply_consumption = 0.02
# Supply consumption determmines how much supply a unit consumes per day

# default_morale = 0.3
# Default morale determines how much extra organisation can be regained
# hourly when not in combat

# combat_width = 0.5
# Combat width determines how much this unit contributes to overall combat width.

# ===========================================

# COSTS

# lend_lease_cost = 1
# Space taken up in convoy

# build_cost_ic = 0.4
# Production Cost - How much factory output this piece of equipment needs

# manpower = 300
# Manpower - Cost in manpower to produce

# training_time = 120
# Training time - Time in days to train this unit

# ===========================================

# OFFENSIVE

# attack = 0.1
# Firepower - Amount of damage done per attack

# soft_attack = -0.1
# Soft Attack - How many attacks the unit can make versus enemies with low hardness. 
# (In this example here, this would mean that the unit would get 10% less Soft Attack than they would usually get from its equipment

# hard_attack = -0.5
# Hard Attack - How many attacks the unit can make versus enemies with high hardness

# air_attack = 1
# Air Attack - How much damage we can do against airplanes. High Air Attack also helps to counter enemy Air Superiority effects

# ap_attack = 1
# Piercing - Having equal or greater Piercing to the targets Armor value allows you to do more damage.

# breakthrough = 0.50
# Breakthrough - How many enemy attacks a unit can attempt to avoid while on the offensive, effectively allowing it to stay on the offense longer.

# ===========================================

# DEFENSIVE

# defense = 0.1
# Defense - How many enemy attacks a unit can avoid whilst on the defensive, effectively allowing it to stay on the defensive longer.

# max_strength = 2
# HP - Strength represents how much damage this unit can suffer before it is destroyed

# armor_value = 0
# Armor - Armor that is higher than the opponents Piercing value reduces damage taken and allows more attacks to occur

# hardness = 0.5
# Hardness - Represents how much of your divsion is made up of armoured vehicles. High Hardness = High Hard Attacks, Low Soft Attack

# entrenchment = 5
# Entrenchment - The ability to make proper defensive entrenchments before a hostile attack

# ===========================================

# UNIQUE

# movement = 0.1                  
# Movement - Changes the unit's speed

# experience_loss_factor = 0.1    
# Exp. Loss - How much experience is lost in a division when they take casualities and have to replace them

# casualty_trickleback = 0.2      
# Trickleback - The proportion of losses in combat that can be saved and returned to the manpower pool

# suppression_factor = 0.1        
# Suppression bonus - Ability to supress local resistance

# reliability_factor = 0.05       
# Reliability - Applies to an equipment type's reliability and reduces the chance of breakdowns and accidents

# recon = 1                       
# Reconnaissance - Increases the chance that this unit can pick better tactics in battle

# initiative = 0.2                
# Initiative - The higher the initiative, the quicker it can reinforce into battle, and the quick is completes its planning
